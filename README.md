As I've recently received some Ghost Atto receivers, which were already flashed with ExpressLRS, I was looking for the firmware files to flash them back into those receivers.
I've flashed them with ST-Link v2 and the ST-Toolkit, but the bootloader needs to be written or extracted.
I'm sorry, that you only find to links and some immersionrc ghost firmware files.

those files where downloaded MANUALLY from this URL: http://immersionrclive.com/cust/ghost.php?version=
list of available firmware files: http://immersionrclive.com/cust/ghostrelease/


PS: Maybe it helps by decoding the protocol for the ORQA fpv.one with ORQA fpv.connect integration, to implement ExpressLRS backpack.
